## Simulations of SMC complex extrusion and analysis of bacterial Hi-C data
This repository contains source code for two articles investigating the *in vivo* activity of Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes. 

These codes were used to perform data analysis of bacterial Hi-C data, and model the process of DNA-loop extrusion by SMC complexes. 

The folder `SMC_transcription_interactions` is related to Ref.1, where we studied the interactions between SMC complexes and active transcription machinery. The folder `SMC_transcription_interactions` is related to Ref. 2, where we investigated various models of interactions between SMC complexes.
