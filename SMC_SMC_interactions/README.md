## About

The following scripts can be used for running and generating Hi-C like contact maps from loop extrusion simulations on a bacterial chromosome. 

The example codes below are broken into two parts: the generation of a semi-analytical Hi-C like map, which uses an approximation to the Gaussian Chain model, and the generation of Hi-C like maps from 3D polymer simulations
1. Example_code_for_simulating_ChIPseq_and_HiC_simulations_semi_analytically.ipynb
    - Generates Hi-C like contact maps and SMC ChIP-seq like occupancy profiles using the semi-analytical approach


2. Example_code_for_3D_polymer_simulation_with_plectonemes_and_single_parS_site
    - Generates Hi-C like contact maps and SMC ChIP-seq like occupancy profiles from 3D polymer simulations


3. Example_code_for_3D_polymer_simulation_with_plectonemes_and_multiple_parS_sites
    - Generates Hi-C like contact maps and SMC ChIP-seq like occupancy profiles from 3D polymer simulations
